# PacketWatch

This is a small project to monitor network traffic and disconnect users with heavy data usage .
The project requires a WiFi adapter with **Monitor Mode** capabilities to perform deauthentication attack . 
It would be best if you can get 5GHz band adapter . 
And the deauthentication attack is written is BASH as of now . Trying to get it in python so it can portable and can be used in Windows as well
